# 08-Breakout
In this repository, I am creating a game similar to Breakout.
* Breakout was an Atari game released in 1976. It used a paddle that the player could move to catch a ball that would bounce back toward some different colored tiles. When the player hit a tile, they would score points, and different colors would score different amounts.
* The goal of the game is to make all the tiles disappear without losing(dropping) your ball.

In this repository, I used my own sprites(which were made with my ipad using Procreate). Fonts were from dafont.com.
- The paddle is controlled using mouse movement (left and right).
- The score increases by varying amounts(depending on tile color).
- The ball can be "respawned" using a mouse click.
- If the ball falls off the screen, the player loses a life.
- If the player's lives reaches zero, GAME OVER!

Good Luck!
